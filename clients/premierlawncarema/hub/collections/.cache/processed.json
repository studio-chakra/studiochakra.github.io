Looks like they built this site recently w/ a non-design focused marketing firm.</li>\n  <li>Using Wordpress</li>\n  <li>Site is responsive but it has a ton of issues and breaks down on mobile screen sizes</li>\n  <li>Clean and simple design approach</li>\n  <li>Phone # and Contact Us module appears on every page</li>\n  <li>Weather widget and Contact Us form appears on most of the internal pages</li>\n  <li>Minimal content</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Header</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Logo</li>\n  <li>Phone number</li>\n  <li>&#8216;Serving South Central MA since 1996&#8217;</li>\n  <li>Main navigation\n    <ul>\n      <li>Home</li>\n      <li>Producs &amp; Services</li>\n      <li>Contact Us / Request Quote</li>\n      <li>Photo Gallery</li>\n      <li>About Us</li>\n      <li>Article Library (basically a blog w/ categories)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Footer</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Minimal Footer, just has copyright information</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Homepage</h5>\n<p>The homepage of the site primarily focuses on a big image w/ parralax. The image offers no context at all, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense. Secondary focus is the Contact Us module and Services grid.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Banner Image</li>\n  <li>Contact Us module</li>\n  <li>Grid of 4 services w/ title, image and learn more</li>\n  <li>Intro text and link to a magazine article they where featured in</li>\n  <li>Little weather widget</li>\n  <li>Featured articles from their &#8216;article library&#8217;</li>\n  <li>Big contact us form</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Content Pages</h5>\n<p>Most of the content pages consist of a big header image along with content in a 2 or 3 column grid, with little short blubs of text. You can tell the tried to get as much content &#8216;above the fold&#8217; as possible.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Products/Services Page\n    <ul>\n      <li>List of services w/ heading and short text, with link to more detailed page.

The site isn&#8217;t too cluttered.</li>\n  <li>About us has photo&#8217;s of the workers, which gives it a personal touch</li>\n  <li>Contact Us module(s) on every page so you are 1 or 2 clicks away from the form interaction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Con&#8217;s</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Doesn&#8217;t make sense to have the Contact Us banner and the actual form module on the same page</li>\n  <li>Weather widget is really cheesy</li>\n  <li>Services images have text in them for each service</li>\n  <li>On all the pages they have this Visa/MC graphic which just looks thrown in.</li>\n  <li>Photo gallery is really tiny. People want to see good photo&#8217;s on what services you can provide, and this isn&#8217;t the way to do it!</li>\n  <li>About us page doesn&#8217;t really say much. </li>\n  <li>Article library is really a poor implementation of a &#8216;blog&#8217;. You have to click the category and then you see the posts, but it&#8217;s not something easy to find, it&#8217;s all text as well and doesn&#8217;t invite users in for reading.</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-babes","alias":"babes","date":"2014-02-25T17:15:43-05:00"},"FilePath":"/collections/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-babes.md","Published":true,"Date":"2014-02-25T17:15:43-05:00","Url":"/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-babes"},"/collections/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-pheasant.md":{"Prefix":"docs","Meta":{"tags":["competitor"],"published":true,"title":"Pheasant Hill Landscape","body":"\n<h6>Premier Lawn Care MA</h6>\n\n<h3>Competitor Review</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>Pheasant Hill Landscape</h1>\n<p>http://www.pheasanthilllandscape.com/</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Screenshots</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/studiochakra/premierlawncarema-dashboard/master/public/img/competitor-screenshots/pheasant-1.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/studiochakra/premierlawncarema-dashboard/master/public/img/competitor-screenshots/pheasant-2.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/studiochakra/premierlawncarema-dashboard/master/public/img/competitor-screenshots/pheasant-3.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/studiochakra/premierlawncarema-dashboard/master/public/img/competitor-screenshots/pheasant-4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>From the website: Pheasant Hill Landscape has proudly served communities throughout the Metrowest, Greater Boston, and central Massachusetts for over 25 years.

It can be used as a reference for common patterns and a summary of features from each review.</p>\n\n<p><em>Last updated: 2014.02.22</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Design &amp; Layout</h2>\n\n<h5>Overall</h5>\n<p>Out of the 4 sites, Babe&#8217;s is the most modern, with LawnDawg coming in second place. Babe&#8217;s is the only site that is responsive and it&#8217;s the cleanest out of all of them.</p>\n\n<h5>Header</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>The header area of all competitor sites where pretty consistent. They all consisted contained:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Logo</li>\n      <li>Phone number (s)</li>\n      <li>Main navigation</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2 of the 4 sites contained account login information that allowed access to custom built account management tools.</li>\n  <li>I feel Lawn Dawg&#8217;s header was the best out of the group, since it grouped links to Estimate, Renew Services &amp; Sign me up together and didn&#8217;t have a full fledged form in the header for the account, but just a &#8216;create account&#8217; and &#8216;login&#8217; links.</li>\n  <li>Lawn Dawg&#8217;s navigation was also the best since it had a bunch of content wich the dropdowns provided easy access too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Footer</h5>\n<p>3 out of the 4 sites didn&#8217;t really have anything in the footer that provided more access to other area&#8217;s of the site. I felt most of the sites didn&#8217;t utilize this space. Each site footer was poor, but out of the lot, Noon was the best. Noon provided secondary navigation and social links at the bottom of every page as well as that awards based banner advertisement. Across all sites, below is a list of features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Secondary nav</li>\n  <li>BBB graphic,</li>\n  <li>Social media links</li>\n  <li>Copywright info</li>\n  <li>Address/Locations</li>\n  <li>History Tagline ie ‘Serving South Central MA since 1996’</li>\n  <li>Contact information</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Homepage</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Each site had a prominent slideshow/banner image at the top</li>\n  <li>2 of the 4 sites had the Quick quote right inside the slideshow</li>\n  <li>Noon had the most informational slideshow, which highlighted it&#8217;s ads, althought done poorly and since the quote form is yellow it&#8217;s staring you right in the face</li>\n  <li>Noon was the only site that had a Video and Testimonial on the homepage</li>\n  <li>I like how Lawn Dawg and Babe&#8217;s had their top 3/4 services to dive into</li>\n  <li>2 of the 4 sites had a couple blog posts</li>\n  <li>All 4 had some type of introductary text, but not prominent at all</li>\n  <li>I like the idea that Lawn Dawg had of having an area for &#8216;whats new&#8217;. I wouldn&#8217;t suggest that exactly but an area on the HP and/or other pages where pressing updates can be implemented (like these specific things to watch out for since it&#8217;s been so hot last week, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Elements, Modules &amp; Components</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Quick/Instant quote form was consistent on all of the sites which provides a 1-click way to submit an inquiry to be contacted by the company without leaving the current page.</li>\n  <li>E Newsletter signup</li>\n  <li>Social sharing buttons</li>\n  <li>Weather widget</li>\n  <li>Buttons to quote form</li>\n  <li>Ads for new services</li>\n  <li>Testimonials</li>\n  <li>Quick quote form</li>\n  <li>Contact form</li>\n  <li>Contact details</li>\n  <li>BBB graphic</li>\n  <li>Angies List Badges</li>\n  <li>History Tagline ie ‘Serving South Central MA since 1996’</li>\n  <li>Slideshow</li>\n  <li>&#8216;New This Year&#8217; ads</li>\n  <li>Gallery</li>\n  <li>Captcha</li>\n  <li>Video&#8217;s</li>\n  <li>Refer a Friend</li>\n  <li>Blog</li>\n  <li>Account login &amp; creation</li>\n  <li>Banner image</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Content</h2>\n<p>The comeptitor sites mostly had a similar content setup. Just basic pages w/ text and imagery in them, nothing special. They all seemed to only have 1 &#8216;content type&#8217;, which is the basic article. Lawn Dawg had the most robust content, organized pretty nicely, although length and probably could of cut the content in half with a good use of imagery.</p>\n\n<p>Below is an outline of all the content you can find across the 4 sites to use for reference:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>About Us</strong> &gt; General information about the company, usually a few paragraphs and some images. Some sites had the history of the company and how it came about</li>\n  <li><strong>Team</strong> &gt; Listing of all team members, with bio&#8217;s, photo&#8217;s and description</li>\n  <li><strong>News</strong> &gt; Listing of news items. Title, date &amp; description w/ link to detail page</li>\n  <li><strong>Service Commitment</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Our Approach</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Services</strong> &gt; Listing of services, all text based and grouped into columns. Some sites had links to more in depth details for each service. Lawn Dawg had all the services categorized into 4 main service pages.</li>\n  <li><strong>Blog</strong> &gt; Typical blog style items w/ detail pages organized into categories.</li>\n  <li><strong>FAQ</strong> &gt; Page dedicated to Frequently asked questions</li>\n  <li><strong>Tips</strong> &gt; Page dedicated to easy tips for customers</li>\n  <li><strong>Newsletter Archive</strong> &gt; Listing of past newsletters by year w/ title &amp; description and a link to the full web-based newsletter</li>\n  <li><strong>Special Offers</strong> &gt; Page dedicated to listing any special offers going on at the time</li>\n  <li><strong>Contact Us</strong> &gt; General contact us form w/ address and contact information and the area they serve</li>\n  <li><strong>Refer a Friend</strong> &gt; Form based page that allows you to put in your information as well as a friends. Explanation of what you get if the friend signs up.</li>\n  <li><strong>Quote/Estimate</strong> &gt; Form page with fields to get a quick estimate via a phone call.</li>\n  <li><strong>Gallery</strong> &gt; Most sites had a simple 1 page gallery. Thumbnail w/ bigger image. Others had the galleries categorized by year. They where all general galleries, and not by the project.</li>\n  <li><strong>Testimonials/Reviews</strong>: Page dedicated to a listing of testimonials, with the persons name and city/state</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-analysis","alias":"comparison","date":"2014-02-26T09:21:36-05:00"},"Published":true,"FilePath":"/collections/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-analysis.md","Date":"2014-02-26T09:21:36-05:00","Url":"/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-analysis"},"/collections/docs/premierlawncarema-competitive-noonturf.md":{"Prefix":"docs","Meta":{"tags":["competitor"],"published":true,"title":"Noon Turf Care","body":"\n<h6>Premier Lawn Care MA</h6>\n\n<h3>Competitor Review</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>Noon Turf Care</h1>\n<p>http://www.noonturfcare.com</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Screenshots</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/studiochakra/premierlawncarema-dashboard/master/public/img/competitor-screenshots/noon-1.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/studiochakra/premierlawncarema-dashboard/master/public/img/competitor-screenshots/noon-2.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/studiochakra/premierlawncarema-dashboard/master/public/img/competitor-screenshots/noon-3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>From the website: Noon Turf Care is a privately owned lawn care company that delivers premium lawn services to New England homes.

It make sense to bring in a few blog posts to the homepage so the content is always changing.</li>\n  <li>Customer testimonials come up in a popup modal</li>\n  <li>Site would benefit from an email newsletter.

They have an image of a dog to tie in their brand as one of the slides. Secondary focus is a listing of services w/ images to their respective sections as well as a module for showcasing what&#8217;s new in 2014. Really nice use of imagery, they probably purchased a ton of stock photos.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Slideshow just consists of images that don&#8217;t releate or click to anywhere else on the site.</li>\n  <li>Quick quote form within the slideshow\n    <ul>\n      <li>Closest Office</li>\n      <li>Name, Email, Phone, Address, City/zip</li>\n      <li>Square footage dropdown</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Small intro to who they are</li>\n  <li>3 Services areas w/ images that link to more details</li>\n  <li>Module for showcasing what&#8217;s new in 2014 w/ more information link</li>\n  <li>Area at the bottom for showcasing they are an &#8216;EarthCare&#8217; provider?</li>\n  <li>2 recent blog posts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Content Pages</h5>\n<p>They have really robust content, almost too much in places, but you can really learn about the company and it&#8217;s offerings, compared to most of the other sites that have only the most basic information, which is rarely enough. All the pages have a prominent header image, and it&#8217;s the same image that is unrelated to the content. Each page has a 3 column approach.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Estimates Page\n    <ul>\n      <li>3 different types of estimates, but mainly use the same form</li>\n      <li>Local office</li>\n      <li>Name, Email, Phone, Address, City, State, Zip</li>\n      <li>Square Footage dropdown</li>\n      <li>Offer Code</li>\n      <li>How&#8217;d you hear about us</li>\n      <li>Captcha</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>About us\n    <ul>\n      <li>Good information overview</li>\n      <li>Executive team lists photos and bio&#8217;s of all major employee&#8217;s</li>\n      <li>News/Events page shows list of items by year, mainly things they&#8217;ve done, reviews from local mags, press releases</li>\n      <li>Have a &#8216;customer service commitment&#8217; page, which outlines their commitment to you, nice idea.</li>\n      <li>Reviews page w/ testimonials from customers</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Services\n    <ul>\n      <li>Basically have 1 page per major service. Lawn service page goes and outlines each season and what to expect, as far as service goes, during each of the 4 seasons. Nice touch, be cool if this was illustrated in some way.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Resources\n    <ul>\n      <li>Tips &amp; Faqs are nice. Probably could all be integrated into a Blog possibly.</li>\n      <li>Newsletter page allows you to download their previous newsletters in PDF form</li>\n      <li>Special offers page doesn&#8217;t really have much, just 1 offer and it&#8217;s text.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Gallery\n    <ul>\n      <li>Have a video gallery in which 1 major question is asked and the video answers the question in detail</li>\n      <li>A single photo gallery per year which showcases client photo&#8217;s.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Blog\n    <ul>\n      <li>Typical, simple blog setup. Have about 1 post per week or every other week on various topics (Lawn Care, Lawn Dawg, Lawn Problems, Tree &amp; Shrub Care, Weeds &amp; Insects)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Contact Us\n    <ul>\n      <li>Customer serivce &amp; sales phone numbers</li>\n      <li>Inquiry Type (gen request, estimate, employment)</li>\n      <li>Closest office</li>\n      <li>Name, Company, Address, City, State, Zip, Email, Phone</li>\n      <li>How did you hear about us?</li>\n      <li>Comments &amp; Captcha</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Refer a Friend Page\n    <ul>\n      <li>$25 credit toward next bill</li>\n      <li>Your Info &amp; Friend Info\n        <ul>\n          <li>Name, Email, Phone, Customer ID (YOU)</li>\n          <li>Name, Address, City, Zip, Phone (FRIEND)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>You can click a link to add a 2nd or 3rd friend</li>\n      <li>Captcha</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Modules</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Quick Quote\n    <ul>\n      <li>Closest Office</li>\n      <li>Name, Email, Phone, Address, City/zip</li>\n      <li>Square footage dropdown</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Social network buttons</li>\n  <li>Newsletter Sign up (email)</li>\n  <li>New This Year Ad, click for free estimate</li>\n  <li>Single testimonial</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Pro&#8217;s</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Like how they have the newsletter archive available on the website</li>\n  <li>Great &amp; robust content</li>\n  <li>Easy access to get an estimate</li>\n  <li>Stock Photo&#8217;s, although they only use 1 for all subpages.</li>\n  <li>Updated blog &amp; Newsletter archives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Con&#8217;s</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Don&#8217;t use images enough to tie in with the content</li>\n  <li>Site doesn&#8217;t really have a primary call to action.
