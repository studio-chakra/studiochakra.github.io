##### Homepage
The homepage of the site primarily focuses on a slideshow of rotating ads to promote services and and instant quote form. Secondary focus is a link to a process video and a single customer testimonial.

- Slideshow
	- Core aeration coupon
	- Flea and Tick control
	- Refer a Friend w/ $30 credit
	- 7-step lawn program
	- Tree & Shrub program
	- Pre-pay savings program
	- Lawn watering savings
- Has a video about their process, linked to youtube that pops up in a modal window
- Single client testimonial
- Instant quote form as the primary call to action

##### Content Pages
Most of the content pages consist of a big header image along with content in a 2 or 3 column grid, with little short blubs of text. You can tell the tried to get as much content 'above the fold' as possible.

- Services Page
	- List of services w/ heading and short text, with link to more detailed page
- Contact Us Page
	- First/Last Name
	- City, State, Address
	- Cell, Home Phone
	- Email
	- Comments
- Refer a Friend Page
	- Get $30 credit if friend signs on
	- Form consists of 2 columns, same information for YOU and your FRIEND
	- First/Last Name
	- Address, Email and Phone

##### Modules
- Instant Quote
	- It's not really 'instant', it just let's you know someone will contact you within 24 hours. Form is ajax based so it doesn't refresh the page
	- Name
	- Address, City, State
	- Phone, Email
	- Authorization code which you have to type in

### Pro's
- Like Refer a Friend & Instant Quote feature, but the Instant Quote is a sham, it's not like you get an email with a quote immediately. Someone actually calls you.
- They keep the site updated well with the Blog & News areas. They seem to put up a blog post maybe once a week.
- Online account for customers seems to be a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a paid for service or something custom they built.
- Good promotion with the use of the slideshow ads on the homepage
- Like how Services page shows a grid of services with 1 paragraph of intro information, and then if you want more details it takes you to another page.

### Con's
-  Site design is horrendous!
- Content throught the site is really poor
- Their Blog is constantly updated yet you have to go to the Blog page. It make sense to bring in a few blog posts to the homepage so the content is always changing.
- Customer testimonials come up in a popup modal
- Site would benefit from an email newsletter. Currently there is no way for clients to know when the site has been updated with new information in the Blog unless they go to the website.
