<h3>Our Solution</h3>

</ul>

<h5>Design &amp; Development Assumptions</h5>

<li>The site will be designed with a &#8216;mobile-first&#8217; approach.</li>

<li>We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. Weâ€™ll also test to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly different, experience.</li>
<li>We will test our work on the following mobile devices including iPhones &amp; iPads (Safari, Google Chrome) and Android 4.x devices (Google Chrome and Firefox) on a wide variety of screen sizes, but you can&#8217;t expect us to test them all!</li>
<li>Domain registrations, SSL certificates, Mechant Accounts, Hosting or any other 3rd party setup costs or monthly fees are not included as part of this proposal.</li>
<li>Project management, communications and tracking will be primarily handled through the use of Basecamp and over the phone.</li>
