### Client Details
POC: Michael Bouffard
Title: Owner/President
Business Name: Premier Lawn Care, Inc.
Email: MBouffard@PremierLawnCareMA.com
Phone: (508) 446-7504

### Project Details
- Focus on lawn/tree fertilization/care to better health and appearance of existing lawn/landscapes
- Quality results. Personalized service. 
- http://www.premierlawncarema.com
- Clients advantage is that they provide detailed notes and suggestions on care of lawn/trees for in between visits to adjust for changes in weather/season 
	- This is done thru paper right now. I think it be great to offer him an alternative solution that is web based. Maybe via a newsletter, or potentially a client-login area where he can assign notes/suggestions on a client by client basis?
	- **Follow up on this feature with client!**

### Current Website Pro's
- Comment section
- Link to direct email
- Layout

### Current Website Con's
- Outdated look, feel and functionality
- Can't update/display work projects easily
- Doesn't draw in any traffic

### Competitors
#### Noon Turf Care (http://www.noonturfcare.com)
- Instant Quote Form
- Refer a friend
- Blog
- Social media links
- Online bill pay and account access for customers
	- Client isn't sure if they are ready for that
	- **Follow up on this feature with client!**

### Audience
- Main users are looking for information on proper agronomics and a way to contact client
- These users are also looking to be informed on the care of their lawn between visits
- Customers are mainly between 35-65

### Redesign
- Primary goal should be inform customers of the company and the quality they can expect.
- Secondary goal is to provide lawn care information to customers and get them to come back to the site to explore more options and be educated, use new tools, etc.
- Feelings: warmth, trust, honest, professional, reliable, friendly
- Look/Feel: Up to date, clean, warm colors (no extreme ‘brights’)

### Redesign Features
- Ratings
	- **Follow up: Blog, Reviews, Projects, Testimonials, Knowledgebase?**
- Comments
	- **Follow up: Blog, Reviews, Projects, Testimonials, Knowledgebase?**
- Forums?
	- **Follow up: Not sure if a Forum for just local customers is going to draw any attention. Need more information on this**
- User Profiles? (client isn't sure if they are ready for that)
	- **Follow up: User profiles would be nice if Client is interested in building a dashboard or account management area into the site.**

## Take Aways
- See if Client is willing to switch to my hosting service
- Need to see new logo, potentially suggest Branding services
- Need to research more competitors
- Had no feedback really on actual 'design' so it's pretty much open for grabs. Seems like I can do what I think is best!
- Review print materials that he gives to customers, see if Client would be interested in creating an online system for that, instead of using print/mail which will end up saving money in the long run.
- I feel the Client could reach it's customers better w/ a monthly newsletter, pitch it!
- Customer online account access would be benificial if it's going to provide a service that customers will use (ie)
- Need to follow up on Client features and my feature idea's
- Stock Photo's? Maybe get a 1 month service for it
- Facebook/Twitter design services?
- Yelp
