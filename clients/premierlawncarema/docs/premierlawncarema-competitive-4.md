##### Overall Design & Technology
- Really poor, outdated old-school site
- Header, nav and text, that's all that is presented here
- Not responsive/mobile friendly

##### Header
- Text, Phone & Tagline w/ image of Flamingo on grass WTH!

##### Footer 
- Copyright info and that's about it!

##### Homepage
The homepage has nothing, text 5 paragraphs of text, super small along with a couple of accrediation images and badges from Angie's List

##### Content Pages
Basially consist of a quick paragraph of text with an image or 2. Nothing to gain from this site, just to see NOT HOW TO DO IT! Other than that there is your basic content page, few client testimonials, a services list and contact page.

##### Modules
- There are none

### Pro's
- BBB Biz badge
- Angies List Award badges

### Con's
- Everything
