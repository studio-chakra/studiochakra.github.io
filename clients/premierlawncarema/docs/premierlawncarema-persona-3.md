### Description
Naruto works as a programmer and system maintenance contractor for a Water treament services company. He spends most of his days traveling, for hours, around various facilities in New England to do routine checks and program system updates.  Naruto lives on a 1.5 acre lot, in a quiet surburbian town surrounded by friendly neighbors and kids.

Naruto is a family man and avid tinkerer in all things. He likes the challenge of doing everything himself, but seeks help when needed. He does most of the maintenance and upkeep around his home. Naruto is married, has 1 son and another child on the way.

Naruto is pretty tech savy, but doesn't really use the computer unless it's for work, checking out the latest sports scores and stats, or needing to research various things on the web. He hates social media, and does not take part in Facebook, Twitter, etc. He tends to do most of his shopping and banking online.

### Tech/Social/Mobile Context
Sharon was born in the 60's so she doesn't have much computer experience. She tends to stay away, as much as possible but is competent in paying bills, sending emails, using Facebook, etc. She only uses Facebook out of all the social networks in order to stay in touch with her family in friends.

Sharon has an 2/3 year old Android based phone. She doesn't use it to surf the web while she is on the go, but mainly to just make calls and exchange text messages. She is primarily a desktop web user.


### Goals / Site Usage
* Looking to find in depth information on lawn treatments since his grass is turning red.
* Wants to know exactly what products, pesticides, etc are used in treatments and how they can effect small children and pets.
* Would like to read up to date information how how to keep his lawn in the best shape from season to season.
* Doesn't spend much time online, but checks email everyday so he'd like to get new information automatically.
* Wants to see if company has any references, reviews or testimonials so he can investigate past issues or complaints.
* Want to be able to contact company directly thru the website and get a quick response
* Would like detailed summary of maintenance performed on the last visit, any issues or problems he should fix and how to do it. Be nice if this could just be online where he could read it while he is at his computer.
* Wants to setup automatic payments for services.
* Would like to see other lawns company has worked on and their results.
* Like to see a calendar of when his services are scheduled.
* Would like to submit questions to the company and get an answer back within a couple of days.

### Frustrations
* Dog is always chewing up the grass.
* Few spots on the lawn are always dead, can't seem to get those fixed.
* Thinks irrigation system isn't watering the lawn evenly, grass is nicer on one side of the house than the other.
* Currently is using another company, but isn't happy with the results, looking for new service.
* Current company doesn't allow him to view or pay bill online.
