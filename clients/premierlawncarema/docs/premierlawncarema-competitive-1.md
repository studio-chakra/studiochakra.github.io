##### Overall Design & Technology
- Semi-modern look. Looks like they built this site recently w/ a non-design focused marketing firm.
- Using Wordpress
- Site is responsive but it has a ton of issues and breaks down on mobile screen sizes
- Clean and simple design approach
- Phone # and Contact Us module appears on every page
- Weather widget and Contact Us form appears on most of the internal pages
- Minimal content

##### Header
- Logo
- Phone number
- 'Serving South Central MA since 1996'
- Main navigation
	- Home
	- Producs & Services
	- Contact Us / Request Quote
	- Photo Gallery
	- About Us
	- Article Library (basically a blog w/ categories)

##### Footer 
- Minimal Footer, just has copyright information

##### Homepage
The homepage of the site primarily focuses on a big image w/ parralax. The image offers no context at all, it doesn't make much sense. Secondary focus is the Contact Us module and Services grid.

- Banner Image
- Contact Us module
- Grid of 4 services w/ title, image and learn more
- Intro text and link to a magazine article they where featured in
- Little weather widget
- Featured articles from their 'article library'
- Big contact us form

##### Content Pages
Most of the content pages consist of a big header image along with content in a 2 or 3 column grid, with little short blubs of text. You can tell the tried to get as much content 'above the fold' as possible.

- Products/Services Page
	- List of services w/ heading and short text, with link to more detailed page. Content is pretty slim but they have images releating to the content which is good.
- Contact Us Page & Module
	- Address, Phone & Fax information for the company
	- First, Last name
	- Email, Phone
	- Subject
	- How can we help you?
- Photo Gallery
	- Just a simple 1 page gallery with 30 or so photo's that automatically flip thru
- About Us
	- Couple paragraphs and a couple images
- Article Library
	- Basically a poor impelmentation of a blog

##### Modules
- Instant Quote
	- It's not really 'instant', it just let's you know someone will contact you within 24 hours. Form is ajax based so it doesn't refresh the page
	- Name
	- Address, City, State
	- Phone, Email
	- Authorization code which you have to type in

### Pro's
- Content is laid out half-way decent, some good use of white space. The site isn't too cluttered.
- About us has photo's of the workers, which gives it a personal touch
- Contact Us module(s) on every page so you are 1 or 2 clicks away from the form interaction

### Con's
-  Doesn't make sense to have the Contact Us banner and the actual form module on the same page
- Weather widget is really cheesy
- Services images have text in them for each service
- On all the pages they have this Visa/MC graphic which just looks thrown in.
- Photo gallery is really tiny. People want to see good photo's on what services you can provide, and this isn't the way to do it!
- About us page doesn't really say much. 
- Article library is really a poor implementation of a 'blog'. You have to click the category and then you see the posts, but it's not something easy to find, it's all text as well and doesn't invite users in for reading.
