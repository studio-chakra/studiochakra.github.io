### Our Solution
We recommend a completely new website, built and designed from scratch. We will take a mobile-first responsive design approach to your website. What this means is that we will optimize and start our design and content approach from mobile users, and then expand upon that or larger devices and desktops. We will create a site that is catered to your core audience w/ an emphasis on trust and quality.

##### Functional & Features
In addition to your requirements, we recommend the following that can be included in the proprosal budget to enhance your site.

- Photo Galleries
- Customer project list and detail pages
- FAQ area
- Customer testimonials and/or reviews
- Knowledge base
- Google analytics integration
- Ad's for specials, etc.

##### Design & Development Assumptions
- The site will be built on a CMS (Content Management Platform) called CraftCMS. This will allow you to update certain area's of your website thru an easy to use administration tool. Only certain area's will be fully integrated into the CMS.
- The site will be designed with a 'mobile-first' approach. 
- We will 'design in the browser' as early as possible.
- Your site will also be built using the latest HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript standards.
- We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. Weâ€™ll also test to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly different, experience. 
- We will test our work on the following mobile devices including iPhones & iPads (Safari, Google Chrome) and Android 4.x devices (Google Chrome and Firefox) on a wide variety of screen sizes, but you can't expect us to test them all!
- Domain registrations, SSL certificates, Mechant Accounts, Hosting or any other 3rd party setup costs or monthly fees are not included as part of this proposal.
