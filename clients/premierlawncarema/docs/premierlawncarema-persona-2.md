### Description
Sharon lives in beautiful Leesburg, VA on a farm with 2 horses and 2 dogs. She works as a vetrinarian at a local Animal hospital and is around animals all day. She owns a huge home, way to big for her needs and has 3 acres of land to take care of.

When Sharon isn't working she's taking care of her home, 2 daughters and 1 year old grandchild. She loves being around family and devotes her life to them. She also owns hew own dog breeading business called 'Fox Fire'. She breeds champion Border Collies.

Sharon is a very caring and giving person, whom doesn't have too much down time on her hands. She's not to good with the computer, but can get by surfing the web, sending emails, printing, etc.

### Tech/Social/Mobile Context
Sharon was born in the 60's so she doesn't have much computer experience. She tends to stay away, as much as possible but is competent in paying bills, sending emails, using Facebook, etc. She only uses Facebook out of all the social networks in order to stay in touch with her family in friends.

Sharon has an 2/3 year old Android based phone. She doesn't use it to surf the web while she is on the go, but mainly to just make calls and exchange text messages. She is primarily a desktop web user.

### Goals / Site Usage
* Wants to find a budget-friendly yard maintenance contractor whom she can trust and not break the bank. Someone who can both cut grass and make sure the lawn is in shape since it's heavily used by horses and dogs.
* Read information about the contractor to see if he/her is trustworthy.
* Doesn't know anything about what's involved with treating a lawn, would like to learn online.
* Wants an easy way to contact and schedule a quick or emergency service.
* Would like a plan she can budget out over the cost of a year, without paying for it all up front, to break the payments into smaller amounts.
* Would like to manage and pay for service online.
* Would like to see, maybe step by step, how the contractor took a similar, poorly treated and neglected lawn, to fruitition, with photo's, details, etc.
* Find out if lawn treatments are pet friendly, would like to read up on that information.
* Wants to be automatically informed when new specials or information is available to the lawn service programs.
* Find contact information and reviews of the contractor to see if anyone in the area has used him/her before.

### Frustrations
* Lawn is always in shambles do to horses and dogs.
* Can't find someone trustworthy and will work with her on her budget.
* Doesn't have an irrigation system.
* Can't find the time to cut the lawn consistently
* Never has hired a lawn maintenance person before, so isn't s ure of what's all involved, what she would get, and if she'd be wasting money or not.
