## Design & Layout

##### Overall
Out of the 4 sites, Babe's is the most modern, with LawnDawg coming in second place. Babe's is the only site that is responsive and it's the cleanest out of all of them.

##### Header
- The header area of all competitor sites where pretty consistent. They all consisted contained:
	- Logo
	- Phone number (s)
	- Main navigation
- 2 of the 4 sites contained account login information that allowed access to custom built account management tools.
- I feel Lawn Dawg's header was the best out of the group, since it grouped links to Estimate, Renew Services & Sign me up together and didn't have a full fledged form in the header for the account, but just a 'create account' and 'login' links.
- Lawn Dawg's navigation was also the best since it had a bunch of content wich the dropdowns provided easy access too.

##### Footer
3 out of the 4 sites didn't really have anything in the footer that provided more access to other area's of the site. I felt most of the sites didn't utilize this space. Each site footer was poor, but out of the lot, Noon was the best. Noon provided secondary navigation and social links at the bottom of every page as well as that awards based banner advertisement. Across all sites, below is a list of features:

- Secondary nav
- BBB graphic,
- Social media links
- Copywright info
- Address/Locations
- History Tagline ie ‘Serving South Central MA since 1996’
- Contact information

##### Homepage
- Each site had a prominent slideshow/banner image at the top
- 2 of the 4 sites had the Quick quote right inside the slideshow
- Noon had the most informational slideshow, which highlighted it's ads, althought done poorly and since the quote form is yellow it's staring you right in the face
- Noon was the only site that had a Video and Testimonial on the homepage
- I like how Lawn Dawg and Babe's had their top 3/4 services to dive into
- 2 of the 4 sites had a couple blog posts
- All 4 had some type of introductary text, but not prominent at all
- I like the idea that Lawn Dawg had of having an area for 'whats new'. I wouldn't suggest that exactly but an area on the HP and/or other pages where pressing updates can be implemented (like these specific things to watch out for since it's been so hot last week, etc.)

## Content
The comeptitor sites mostly had a similar content setup. Just basic pages w/ text and imagery in them, nothing special. They all seemed to only have 1 'content type', which is the basic article. Lawn Dawg had the most robust content, organized pretty nicely, although length and probably could of cut the content in half with a good use of imagery.

Below is an outline of all the content you can find across the 4 sites to use for reference:

- **About Us** > General information about the company, usually a few paragraphs and some images. Some sites had the history of the company and how it came about
- **Team** > Listing of all team members, with bio's, photo's and description

- **Service Commitment**
- **Our Approach**

- **Blog** > Typical blog style items w/ detail pages organized into categories.
- **FAQ** > Page dedicated to Frequently asked questions
- **Tips** > Page dedicated to easy tips for customers
