##### Homepage
The homepage of the site primarily focuses on a slideshow of rotating ads to promote services and a quick quote form. They have an image of a dog to tie in their brand as one of the slides. Secondary focus is a listing of services w/ images to their respective sections as well as a module for showcasing what's new in 2014. Really nice use of imagery, they probably purchased a ton of stock photos.

- Slideshow just consists of images that don't releate or click to anywhere else on the site.
- Quick quote form within the slideshow
	- Closest Office
	- Name, Email, Phone, Address, City/zip
	- Square footage dropdown
- Small intro to who they are
- 3 Services areas w/ images that link to more details
- Module for showcasing what's new in 2014 w/ more information link
- Area at the bottom for showcasing they are an 'EarthCare' provider?
- 2 recent blog posts

##### Content Pages
They have really robust content, almost too much in places, but you can really learn about the company and it's offerings, compared to most of the other sites that have only the most basic information, which is rarely enough. All the pages have a prominent header image, and it's the same image that is unrelated to the content. Each page has a 3 column approach.

- Estimates Page
	- 3 different types of estimates, but mainly use the same form
	- Local office
	- Name, Email, Phone, Address, City, State, Zip
	- Square Footage dropdown
	- Offer Code
	- How'd you hear about us
	- Captcha
- About us
	- Good information overview
	- Executive team lists photos and bio's of all major employee's
	- News/Events page shows list of items by year, mainly things they've done, reviews from local mags, press releases
	- Have a 'customer service commitment' page, which outlines their commitment to you, nice idea.
	- Reviews page w/ testimonials from customers
- Services
	- Basically have 1 page per major service. Lawn service page goes and outlines each season and what to expect, as far as service goes, during each of the 4 seasons. Nice touch, be cool if this was illustrated in some way.
- Resources
	- Tips & Faqs are nice. Probably could all be integrated into a Blog possibly.
	- Newsletter page allows you to download their previous newsletters in PDF form
	- Special offers page doesn't really have much, just 1 offer and it's text.
- Gallery
	- Have a video gallery in which 1 major question is asked and the video answers the question in detail
	- A single photo gallery per year which showcases client photo's.

	- Typical, simple blog setup. Have about 1 post per week or every other week on various topics (Lawn Care, Lawn Dawg, Lawn Problems, Tree & Shrub Care, Weeds & Insects)

	- Inquiry Type (gen request, estimate, employment)

	- Closest Office
	- Name, Email, Phone, Address, City/zip
	- Square footage dropdown
- Social network buttons
- Newsletter Sign up (email)
- New This Year Ad, click for free estimate

### Pro's
- Like how they have the newsletter archive available on the website
- Great & robust content
- Easy access to get an estimate
- Stock Photo's, although they only use 1 for all subpages.
- Updated blog & Newsletter archives

### Con's
-  Don't use images enough to tie in with the content
- Site doesn't really have a primary call to action. Everything is really all on the same level.
- No real 'wow' factor and the site isn't too engaging aside from the nice homepage slideshow photos.
- Social media icons sorta get lost in the footer
